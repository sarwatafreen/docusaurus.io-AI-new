# Module 2 – Simulation: Gazebo & Physics (Weeks 5-7)

Welcome to the world of robot simulation! In this module, you'll learn to create realistic physics-based simulations using Gazebo and prepare your robot for the real world. Simulation is the foundation for training robots safely and efficiently before deploying them in the real world.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Master Gazebo simulation environment
- Understand physics engines and their parameters
- Control robots in simulated environments
- Implement realistic sensor models and feedback
- Create custom simulation scenarios

## What is Robot Simulation?
Robot simulation is a virtual environment that mimics the real world to test and develop robots without physical limitations. It allows:
- Safe testing of new algorithms
- Rapid prototyping without hardware costs
- Reproducible experiments
- Training for real-world deployment

## Why Simulation Matters
Before robots enter the real world, they must be thoroughly tested in simulation. Major robotics companies like Boston Dynamics and Tesla use simulation extensively to train their robots. Understanding simulation is key to:
- Reducing development time
- Improving robot safety
- Testing edge cases
- Training AI models with synthetic data

## Module Structure
This module is structured as a 3-week learning journey:
- Week 5: Introduction to Gazebo and basic simulation
- Week 6: Physics simulation and sensor modeling
- Week 7: Advanced simulation features and integration with ROS 2

Let's dive into the world of robot simulation and build your simulated robots!
