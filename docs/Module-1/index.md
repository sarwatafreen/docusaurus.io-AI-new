# Module 1 – ROS 2: The Robot Nervous System (Weeks 1-4)

Welcome to the foundation of robotics! ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the communication framework that connects all parts of a robot, from sensors to actuators, just like the nervous system connects all parts of a human body.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2
- Create your first "Hello World" robot
- Control robot movement with keyboard commands
- Master ROS 2 communication patterns (topics & services)
- Build your own humanoid robot model using URDF

## What is ROS 2?
ROS 2 is the next-generation Robot Operating System, designed for production robotics applications. Unlike traditional software frameworks, ROS 2 provides:
- Distributed computing across multiple machines
- Real-time performance capabilities
- Security features for production environments
- Standardized interfaces for robot hardware

## Why ROS 2 Matters
ROS 2 isn't just software—it's the universal language of robotics. Every major robotics company, from Boston Dynamics to Tesla, uses ROS or ROS-based systems for robot development. Understanding ROS 2 opens doors to:
- Robotics research positions
- Industry robotics roles
- Creating your own robotic systems
- Contributing to the global robotics community

## Module Structure
This module is structured as a 4-week learning journey:
- Week 1: Introduction to ROS 2 concepts and installation
- Week 2: Creating your first robot and basic movement
- Week 3: Understanding ROS 2 communication patterns
- Week 4: Building your own humanoid robot model

Let's begin this journey into the world of robotics!
