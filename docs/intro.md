# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
## From Zero to Voice-Controlled Humanoid in 12 Weeks (Beginners Welcome)

Welcome to the future! This course will take you from zero knowledge to building a voice-controlled humanoid robot in just 12 weeks.

## Why Physical AI Matters
Robots are leaving screens and entering our world. Humanoids will live with us because they have arms, legs, and can learn from YouTube like humans.

## What You Will Build (Week 12)
A simulated humanoid that hears "Bring me the red cup", walks across the room, picks it up, and brings it back — using only your voice.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will master:
1. **ROS 2 from scratch** - The robot nervous system
2. **Make robots walk in simulation** - Digital twins that learn
3. **Add eyes (camera + LiDAR) and brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception and action
4. **Control robots with your voice + ChatGPT** - The future of human-robot interaction

This comprehensive curriculum is designed to take you from beginner to building your own humanoid robot. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional looking to enter the Physical AI space, this course provides the structured learning path you need.

Ready to build the future? Let's get started!

## Hardware Requirements

### Best Student Kit (~$700 total):
